      <h1>A Beginner's Journey to Ceramics</h1>
        <p>Ceramics. It may seem to be just a hobby - but it's more. It's an art, a skill, it's a way of life. Venturing on this journey is one that takes stamina, fortitude, and dertermination. But these sacrifices are worth it, for every morsel of hard work you put into honing the craft, you will find tenfold the amount of satisfaction.</p>
