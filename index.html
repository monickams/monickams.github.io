      <h2>The First Step</h2>
          <p>A journey of a thousand miles begins with one step, and the first step to beginning one's relationship with ceramics begins with the careful curation of a pinch pot. The ideal position for a novice to begin, the pinch pot allows an aspiring ceramicist to get a feel for the clay. </p>
           <h3>Making My First Pinch Pot</h3>
             <p>Upon wedging my first block of clay, I was struck with a dire revalation. The legnth of my fingernails proved to be a hinderance to my ability to manipulate the reddish-brown, recycled clay! Enduring the struggles of moist, grainy, cakey clay under my nails, I braved the first day of pinch-pot curating. I cut my nails immediatley upon arriving home.</p>

      <h2>The Step Between the First and the Second</h2>
            <p>Once I had shortened the duration of my finger nails, I honed the intricate craft of pinch-pot curation. With this newly acquire power, I implemented these skills to devise a pumpkin of perfection - two pinch pots blended into a symmetrical sphere, etched with long indents that bore down the pumkin's side, and an unruly, charming stem - borne of pressing clay through a garlic press - that sprouted from the pumkin's head.</p>
